# Natural Language of Structured Programming
Building a Music Player using Processing.org and Minim

**CAUTION:** Repository and Website *UNDER CONSTRUCTION*

Note: all programs can be written between static and dynamic. Static allows for specific, single lines of code to be recognized in more complicated programs as part of simle algorithms.

CAUTION: bugs are sometimes built in since identifying errors is part of learning

DIVs
- Layout where all the pieces of the GUI are

2D Buttons
- Extra Feature: Hover-over Feedback
- Extra Feature, material design, see Google Prototyping video

Images
- Simple images, no aspect ratio
- Data: images change with song (leading to multiple arrays)
- Algorithm: images in aspect ration
- Idea: drag and drop

- Emphasize how the shape is drawn in the abstract DIV
- Then emphasize the X&Y variables move the abstract shape to a specfic location
- Introduces procedures

- Extra Features: tint, etc.

Ideas:
- drag and drop



Text
- Meta Data Only
- as a check of the image aspect ratio
- Extra Features


Need a flowchart about how the music buttons what the will control 
- Simple Buttons
- Scrolling feature
- Intermediate: parameters of simple buttons
- Intermediate: combinations of simple buttons
- Intermediate: using void draw() {} as play
- Intermediate: minimalistic buttons and intuitive feel
- Advanced: saving preferences and which song, position


Colours: Day, Dark, Night Modes

NEXT & PREVOIUS Button
Lesson for NEXT: layout functions strips in jigsaw
Student Complete Previous

Data Structures
- Song # | Meta Data for Strings and Numbers
- Image # | Connected to Song #

TBA: GUI Overlap and difficulty reading it

Grading & APP Ideas
- LIbrary
- Play Song
- All DIVs
- 2D Shapes
- Music Functions
- Buttons
- Images
- Text

---

Hoverover

---

# To Include
- DIVs give opportunity to visually see completed variable manipulation | use print() & println()
- 2D Images gives opportunity to create library code for different Music Function Buttons
   - Lesson is about putting multiple shapes into one extra large DIV
   - Able to copy and paste after
   - Proceudres will make this exercise easier
