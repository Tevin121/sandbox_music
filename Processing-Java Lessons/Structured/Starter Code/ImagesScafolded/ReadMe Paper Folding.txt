Demo Soccer ball image (from Amazon.com) in WORD
Square does not change
Will become an oval is aspect ratio changes

Aspect Ratio is coolest of math calculations
(From Junior High)
Ruled by common sense - what is ruled by common sense these days?

Start with two pieces of full 11x8.5
- Fold one large square
- measure each paper under DOC Cam

Divide both dimensions, does not matter which is first
Answer will be >1, <1, or =1
Thus, can divide length by width and doesn't matter if 

Answer >1, multiply smaller dimension to get larger dimension
Answer <1, divide smaller dimension to get larger dimension
Answer >1, divide larger dimension to get smaller dimension
Answer <1, multiple larger dimension to get smaller dimension

Record what is common sense to Aspect Ratio
What is the math
- what dimension do we have (large or small)
- what dimension do we want (large or small)
- which ratio do we have & should we multiply or divide

Handout 11x17, scissors, and ruler (use old paper for BLOCKS)
Need scaled down 11x8.5

Computers do something called image resizing very easily
- stretching or shrinking pixels is easy and the image looks exactly the same
- if an image has very little memory, this image can appear pixelated

A small or big image will fit in a rect() 
- the smaller dimension will not look weird, =1
- the larger dimension will change aspect ration

CAUTION: will the image fit inside it's frame

Do a couple of examples, then write an algorithm in groups on a 11x17
- will an 11x8.5 fit in given rectangles

Students need to write out algorithm for Aspect Ration
- What do they have? (Variables for dimensions of image and DIV, ratio
- What is being compared? (Create BLOCKS for variables)
- What are they trying to do? (What will result tell us?)
