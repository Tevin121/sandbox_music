Procedural calls the same ternary operator and code structure in different ways

Procedural calls should finishes algorithm so it is self-completing - mathematically determining the domain of possible case studies using a particular number system (Real Numbers as Geometry)

Next Step: if the calculated dimension is too big for the space, the other dimension should be calculated 
- a catch all that switches the procedures
