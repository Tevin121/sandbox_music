To-Do On Paper: developing formulae

Instead of TERNARY Operator, using IF-Else to automatically use the unused space in the DIV
- able to repeat TERNARY Operator but can get complicated

RECT(): X+WIDTH or Y+HEIGHT will then subtracting from  divWidth or divHeight will get unused space

TRIANGLE():
- X2-X1 subtracted from the WIDTH will get unused X-SPACE
- Y2-Y1 subtracted from the HEIGHT will get unused Y-SPACE
